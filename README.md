<p>Automate component removal with the Deleteable class.
<p>Handle user input, mouse events, and keyboard input seamlessly.
<p>Implement interactive elements with customizable appearance and behavior.
<p>Develop complex game logic, movement, and physics for actors.
<p>Create dynamic user interfaces with buttons and textboxes for user interaction.

## utilities.py
Description: This module contains a collection of utility functions for various tasks involving Pygame, ranging from image loading and manipulation to geometric calculations and widget positioning.

### Functions:

<p>center_rects(ref_rect, rect_to_center): Calculate the position to center a rectangle within another reference rectangle.
<p>split_text_into_lines(text, width, font_size): Split a text into lines that fit within a given width based on the font size.
<p>load_image(name, data_dir, colorkey=None, scale=1, size=None): Load an image from a file with optional scaling and colorkey.
... (List of all utility functions)

### Classes:

<p>timer: Timer class for measuring time intervals.

## AnimationClasses.py
<p>Description: This module extends Pygame's capabilities by offering classes and utilities for creating interactive and animated game objects.

### Classes:
